ABOUT THE FILES IN THE FOLDER mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/.

  * dispatch.go contains func Do which dispatches the LPC ( Local Process Communications ) messages received from the renderer.
    Do not edit the file dispatch.go.
    In func Do, the messages are dispatched to the LPC message handlers here in this folder.

  Message handler files:

  * Log.go was generated by kickwasm when this framework was created.
    The file contains func handleLog(rxMessage *message.LogRendererToMainProcess, sending lpc.Sending)
      which processes the log message received from the renderer.
	You may edit the file if you need to.

ABOUT THE FILES IN THE FOLDER domain/lpc/message/.

* Log.go was generated by kickwasm when this framework was created.
  The file contains the types of the 2 Log messages.
	1. LogRendererToMainProcess is the message that the renderer sends to the main process.
	2. LogMainProcessToRenderer is the message that the main process sends to the renderer.

MANAGING LPC MESSAGES WITH kicklpc.

* Use kicklpc in this application's root folder:
  $ cd github.com/josephbudd/kickwasm/examples/spawnwidgets/

* Listing all of the messages:
  $ kicklpc -l
  1. kicklpc would
    * Display the names of each LPC message.

* Adding a message:
  $ kicklpc -add UpdateCustomer
  1. kicklpc would
    * Add the file domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Add the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Update the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/dispatch.go
  2. You would need to
	* Complete the message definitions in domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
	* Complete the func handleUpdateCustomer in mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go

* Deleting a message:
  $ kicklpc -delete-forever UpdateCustomer
  1. kicklpc would
    * Delete the file domain/lpc/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Delete the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/UpdateCustomer.go
    * Update the file mainprocess/lpc/dispatch/dispatch.go
