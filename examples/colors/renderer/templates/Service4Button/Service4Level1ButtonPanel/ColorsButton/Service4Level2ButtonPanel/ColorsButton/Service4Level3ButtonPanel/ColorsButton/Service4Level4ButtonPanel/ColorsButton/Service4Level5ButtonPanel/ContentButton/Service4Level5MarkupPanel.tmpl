<h3>The User Experiences Your Services Not This Interface.</h3>
<p>
This is an example of content that you would provide.
It has the same shape and the same background color as this level's button pad.
</p>
<p>
You can see this level's button pad by clicking the tall back button at the left.
The tall back button at the left always has the same background color as the level that it goes back to.
At the moment is has the background color of this level because it goes back to this level's button pad.
</p>
<p>
This interface offers few distraction because it
<ul>
  <li>is very minimal and simple in its presentation,</li>
  <li>is very minimal and simple in its functions,</li>
  <li>
    is consistent with colors and shapes.
    Even the switch from a button pad to your content is less dramatic because content area is the same color and shape as the button pad.
    See for yourself. Switch back and forth between this content and this level's button pad.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It allows the user to focus on
<ul>
  <li>your content,</li>
  <li>the complexity of your services.</li>
</ul>

  I built this example application with kick's <b>-cc</b>  flag which added the cookie crumb like headings under the application name.
  The cookie crumbs are only intended to help orientate the user in an application.
  The cookie crumbs are not clickable and are off by default.
  If like me, you think that they might be a distraction more then an aid, you don't have to add them.
