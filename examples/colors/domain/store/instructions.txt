ABOUT THE FILES IN domain/store/

* domain/store/stores.go defines the type Stores struct.
The type Stores has each one of your data stores as a member.
  * Each local bolt data store.
  * Each remote data store.
Package main's func buildStores() will build a pointer to a type Stores.
It will eventually end up being passed to your lpc message handlers
  so that they can use your data stores which are contained in the Stores.

ABOUT THE FILES IN package main.

* stores.go in func buildStores(), builds a store.Stores. A struct store.Stores is defined in domain/store/stores.go.

* main.go gets the store.Stores from func buildStores() and passes it on to your LPC message handlers so that they can get data from and put data into your data stores.
